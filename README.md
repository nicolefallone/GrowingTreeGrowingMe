# GrowingTreeGrowingMe
Growing Tree Growing me is a reflection of my personal growth through a fractal tree. The tree starts small and slowly grows over time until it is fully blossomed. However, if the user clicks the tree, they hinder its growth. It is only after a certain amount of time that the tree can start slowly growing again. The tree represents my personal growth and how toxic relationships hinder that.
